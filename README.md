What it looks like after using it a few times. It saves previous searches on the side as you go. Saves them to local storage to be pulled up on page refresh.

Not a huge fan of build from scratch projects personally, mostly because I really dislike using css, but honestly this was mostly styled using bootstrap so it was a lot easier. Pretty fun to figure out how to use two apis in conjunction, one to pull the latitude and longitude and the other to use those to pull weather data. Overall a fun project that helped me learn more about apis in general.
